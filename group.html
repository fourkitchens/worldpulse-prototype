<h2>What does "Universal Internet Access and Digital Freedom" mean to YOU?</h2>

<blockquote>"[This issue] is about whether we live on a planet with one Internet, one global community, and a common body of knowledge that benefits and unites us all, or a fragmented planet in which access to information and opportunity is dependent on where you live and the whims of censors." —Hillary Clinton, U.S. Secretary of State</blockquote>

<p>Today, freedom of expression and equal access to knowledge and ideas has become synonymous with access to the Internet. As we witness on PulseWire every day, the Web has opened a new frontier for the free exchange of ideas, exposure to new markets, and global forums for building movements. Yet hundreds of thousands of people are excluded from participating—due to cost and infrastructure, threats to safety, government censorship, etc.</p>

<p>World Pulse invites women worldwide to share their personal testimonies on obstacles faced and risks taken in accessing the Internet to seek information, speak freely, and connect globally.</p>
