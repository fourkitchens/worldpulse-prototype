<p class="lead">As a young child, 21-year-old Bwela Nchimunya Moombe lost her sister to HIV/AIDS. Today, she is an outspoken advocate for the rights of women in her community.</p>

They say people come and go in our lives, but when she left us, it left a deep scar in my heart. Your memory will live on forever, my dearest sister. Rest in peace.

I was nine years old when I lost my sister to the deadly AIDS virus. Every time I narrate this story, I can’t help but struggle to hold back my tears. In my culture, it is considered a great wealth to have a family of girl children, and losing one is the greatest loss imaginable. And yet, it is a common occurrence here in Zambia. 14.3% of our 13.3 million people suffer from HIV/AIDS, the majority being women.

I grew up in the suburbs of Ndola, Zambia. As a child, I loved to play on my mother’s farm, where she grew maize, soya beans, and groundnuts. I still remember playing hide and seek amidst the crops, smiling and feeling immensely happy.

But despite this happiness, I was always haunted by the condition of my sister. It was a living nightmare to watch her body deteriorate and waste away. And this was made more difficult by the silence that surrounded it.

My family did not tell me what was going on with my beloved sister, only that she was ill. In 2002, before the government declared Zambia’s AIDS epidemic an emergency, it was hard for people to talk openly about HIV/AIDS. Even today, stigma makes it difficult to discuss the condition, but we have come a long way and now it is more common to hear about the disease.

"What is wrong with my sister?" I would constantly ask my mother and father. They did not give me a straight answer. I continued living life full of suspicion and inner grief. I always prayed for my sister's health as my dad convinced me she was only suffering from Tuberculosis.
